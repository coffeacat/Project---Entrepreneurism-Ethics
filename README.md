# Project Entrepreneurism-Ethics

## 1.A. Company Name LANS AI

## 1.B Long-Term Vision Statement

  Our goal at Lans AI is to democratize access to transformative AI technology for small businesses who are currently being left behind in the digital revolution. We're creating an AI-powered platform that analyzes website content, identifies operational challenges, and matches these businesses with tailored AI solutions from our extensive agent database. 

  This idea originated from witnessing the growing digital divide—while large corporations leverage sophisticated AI tools to dominate markets, small businesses struggle to compete, often lacking both resources and expertise to identify where AI implementation could save them from obsolescence. 

  Lans AI's purpose is to level the playing field by creating an accessible bridge between existing small business websites and life-changing AI tools that can dramatically improve their efficiency and competitiveness. Our mission is to empower the backbone of local economies, the small business owner, with technology that was previously out of reach while our values center on economic justice, community resilience, and inclusive prosperity. 

The key questions guiding our startup are: "How can we create an AI matching system that provides small businesses with transformative solutions they would otherwise never discover?" and "How can we ensure our platform serves as a lifeline for struggling entrepreneurs in underserved communities who risk being permanently displaced in an AI-powered economy?"

## 1.C. Strategy with Ethical Impacts AND Ethical Safeguards

## 1.C.1.1 OKR1 Objective and Key Result

  Lans.ai will maintain an average of 10% conversion rate from all web traffic and site visitors  within the first three months after our service’s launch. This means that for every 100 site visitors, at least 10 should sign up, engage with our AI powered matching system, and either complete a business assessment, request a consultation, or purchase an AI solution from one of our partners. This metric is important because it indicates early marketfit, and validates the effectiveness of Lans.ai’s service for new and small businesses. This metric is also a reflection on how well our service resonates with our client demographic, how valuable this service is seen by the wider market, and how effective our marketing has been for Lans.ai. 
  Key stakeholders of Lans.ai involve the small business using Lans.ai, their customers and clients who benefit from the improvements Lans.ai provides to those they do business with, the AI solution providers which we recommend to our small and new business clients, investors and funding partners, and the founders of Lans.ai. An early conversion rate of 10% or higher is important to all parties involved as it validates our mission and market fit. It gives our investors and funding partners confidence that their investment is going towards a service that is in demand, which makes further investment more appealing. Lans.ai having this support and funding allows us to continue improving our services by enabling us to expand our outreach to both AI solutions providers looking for more clients, and underserved small businesses who benefit from the even playing field AI solutions provides. Our small business clients' own clients are additional stakeholders who must be considered, as the service we provide will have a direct impact on the operations of the businesses from which those clients deal with.


## 1.C.1.2 OKR1 Metric(s) with Experiment(s)

To measure the success of this OKR we will run experiments on the following metrics:

- Attain a minimum of 10% customer conversion rate by using testimonials, and success stories. 
- Track browsing time of each user, and analyze the activity of users who purchase a service through us vs the percentage of users who do not. 
- Identify breakpoints in the onboarding process from signup to purchase, and ensure at least 50% of users engage with Lans.ai after being recommended a service.


### Experiments to reach these metrics involve:

#### Attain a minimum of 10% customer conversion rate by using testimonials, and success stories:
Attain a minimum of 10% customer conversion rate by using testimonials, and success stories:
1. Run A/B testing utilizing testimonials and success stories shown to the user 
more often and throughout the Lans.ai onboarding process from sign up to purchase of a service.

2. Monitor which businesses and engage more with Lans.ai to identify trends
in which users do not perceive Lans.ai service value favorably.

3. Improve engagement from the users not interested in our services
through implementing suggestions from feedback surveys sent to those
who sign up but do not purchase.


#### Track browsing time of each user, and analyze the activity of users who purchase a service through us vs the percentage of users who do not:
1. Track percentage of users who spent less than 10 seconds on Lans.ai, and implement UI and UX changes that encourage engagement through a more aesthetically pleasing UI and UX [1].
2. Measure conversion rates based on browsing times, with the goal of increasing conversion from users who browse for more than 3 minutes not including sign up time.
3. Measure the average time it takes to finish sign up, and streamline the process to reduce sign up time and allow users to start browsing for a purchase faster.	

#### Identify breakpoints in the onboarding process from signup to purchase, and ensure at least 90% of users engage with Lans.ai after being recommended a service:
1. Identify where in the onboarding and purchasing process Lans.ai experiences the most drop off, and implement reminders to encourage reengagement. This could be “item is still in your cart” SMS messages or reminders to log back in to browse for more AI solutions if they did not initially find a suitable product or service.
2. Change the UI and UX design to encourage users to further engage with and click on the AI services we recommend while on site, after receiving the recommendation rather than logging off and returning later.
3. Implement an AI agent that can answer questions about Lans/ai’s recommendations to the user, to reduce doubt and encourage a purchase by reinforcing the idea that Lans.ai will fulfill the clients business desires and needs [2].

   Analyzing these metrics through experimentation and implementing the appropriate changes made from the collected information regarding the onboarding and purchasing process will lead to gradually improved retention and conversion rates for prospective clients of Lans.ai

## 1.C.1.3 Ethical Impact(s)/Issue(s)

### Expected Ethical Impact Risk table

   Lans.ai poses different levels of risk to its various stakeholders. Small business clients experience moderate financial risk due to limited capital, though this is lessened by discounted AI service offerings. They face high privacy risk and moderate rights risk, given Lans.ai’s access to sensitive data, but a low conflict of interest risk, as they typically lack AI affiliations. AI solutions partners encounter moderate financial, privacy, and rights risks, mainly from data breach exposure and uncertainty in ROI. However, conflict of interest remains low due to Lans.ai’s neutral B2B approach. For investors and funders, financial risk is high—as is common with startups—while privacy, rights, and conflict of interest risks are minimal, protected by investment agreements. Finally, the end customers of Lans.ai’s clients face little to no risk across all areas, since Lans.ai does not collect or manage their information directly.


| Stakeholder | Financial Risk | Privacy Risk | Conflicting Interest Risk | Violation of Rights |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Small Business Owners | High | High | Low | Mid |
| AI Solutions Providers | Mid | Mid | Low | Mid |
| Investors/Funding Partners | High | Low | Low | Low |
| Small Business Owners's Customers | Low | None | Low | None |

  The financial risk for our target demographic of small business owners is moderate. One of the main issues small businesses face is handicapped growth due to a lack of spare capital, but our service includes discount rates from the AI solutions providers we partner specifically to help offset the costs. 

  The privacy risk for our small business clients is high. Because Lans.ai is a B2B service through which purchases are made on our platform, we are responsible for billing information, individual personal information, and businesses' information, all of which have a potential to be exposed in the event of a data breach. 

  However, these small businesses have a low conflicting interest risk because our target demographic is small companies who have not yet implemented AI into their business model. These companies should have almost no overlap with the AI Solutions companies who we recommend to clients on Lans.ai. 

  There is a moderate risk of rights violations for our small business clients, because we manage potentially compromising private data such as billing information, which could be exposed in a data breach.

  Our AI solutions providers partners face moderate financial risk from partnering with Lans.ai. The price they pay to be recommended by Lans.ai to potential new clients and the risk that this payment is ultimately fruitless exists, and remains a risk until Lans.ai itself grows as a business. As with any business, there's a chance Lans.ai does not find success, which results in wasted resources for our partners. 

  Our partners also face moderate privacy risks in the forms of potential data breaches leaking company financial information. With our partners, there is a low risk of conflict of interest while working with Lans. Lans.ai is a B2B model, which does not benefit from any specific AI powered tool or service our partners provide. The AI solutions providers we work with face a moderate risk of rights violations, which could result from a data breach, contractual disputes, or unfair business practices such as biases in our matching algorithm.

  Lans.ai's investing and funding partners face a high financial risk, which is the nature of investing into a startup company. Their primary risk is Lans.ai not finding any success, and not providing a return on their investment. The privacy risk for our investing and funding partners is low. Data breaches are always a risk, but typically they target information which will financially benefit a malicious actor, such as sensitive company, account, and personal information[3]. 

  The conflict of interest risk is low for investors and funding partners, as Lans.ai is not yet an established business that can significantly affect the market, competitors, or the other investments of our funding partners. The risk of a violation of rights for our financial partners is low due to the plethora of contracts and investment agreements involved with their investments in our company, all of which protect their rights.

  Our customers' customers face low to no financial risk because our B2B model and company's success will not directly affect their purchasing power, it will only serve to improve the businesses they buy from. The risk to their privacy and personal information is low, as we do not store or ask for our clients' customers' information. For this reason, there also is low risk for a conflict of interests involving our clients' customer information. This is also why these stakeholders face no risk of the violation of their rights, as we do not interact directly with them or their information.

## 1.C.1.4 Ethical Safeguards

To alleviate these issues and enforce ethical business practice for Lans.ai, we will do the following:

  We will uphold both a privacy and data protection policy, and a set of strong security protocols every client and partner involved with Lans.ai can refer to, which will clearly explain the types of data collected as well as how it is used, the steps we take to secure their information, and the reasons for collecting data such as web traffic and browsing activity within the platform. Additionally, upon visiting our platform the option to reject our tracking methods and cookies will be presented, in compliance with the California consumer Privacy Act [4]. This privacy policy will be easily accessible to every user from any platform they can access Lans.aifrom, and a copy will be emailed to each user who makes an account for their business with us. 

  To create our security protocols, our privacy and data protection policy and best communicate to our clients and partners the risks inherent to utilizing Lans.ai as a service, we will consult with legal and compliance experts, as well as cyber security experts who can inform us of the best ways to handle our clients' and partners' data. A number of firms and companies offer these services, such as Deloitte and EY, who we would employ to help form our policies, better understand the security risks involved, and communicate this clearly to our clients.

  Measuring the effectiveness of our privacy and data protection policy will be done by monitoring the opt-in and opt-out rates of our users, with lower opt out rates signifying an agreeable privacy policy and higher rates signaling an unreasonable or intrusive policy. Additionally, our privacy policy will be constructed to have as close to a 12-15 range Flesch-Kinaid english readability score as possible. This range denotes text that is on the lower end of what is considered "advanced" reading material and is generally accessible to college level readers [5]. Because business owners are likely to have at least a college level understanding of English, a 12-15 readability score will help our privacy policy's ability to inform our clients of their privacy rights and options.


## 1.C.2.1 OKR2 Objective and Key Result
  Lans AI will democratize AI access by achieving an 85% match accuracy between small business needs and relevant AI solutions, with 70% of matched businesses implementing at least one recommended tool within 3 months. The Lans AI system must be designed to accommodate the specific needs of small business owners who often lack technical expertise, face resource constraints, and have limited time to research technology solutions. 

  Key stakeholders include the small business owners who are at risk of being left behind in the digital revolution, the AI tool providers seeking to expand their customer base, and local business associations interested in supporting community economic resilience. Additionally, other parties such as municipal governments and economic development organizations may also be impacted as the success of local businesses directly affects community prosperity. The platform serves as a bridge between underserved businesses and transformative AI tools they would otherwise never discover, helping level the playing field in an increasingly technology-driven marketplace.

## 1.C.2.2 OKR2 Metric(s) with Experiment(s)

#### Metric(s) with Experimentation
  Increase website traffic by 150% and achieve a 30% blog-to-search conversion rate within 6 months. This study would track 1,000 website visitors, measuring:

- Source attribution for blog visitors (organic search, social media, referrals)
- Time spent on specific blog topics categorized by industry type
- Click-through rates from blog posts to the search tool functionality

  The data analysis would determine which content types and topics most effectively drive users to the core search feature.

Another experiment could include user journey analysis for blog visitors. This would involve:

- Setting up funnel visualization to track the path from initial blog visit to newsletter subscription to search tool usage
- Evaluating which call-to-action placements and messaging generate the highest conversion rates
- Measuring engagement time with specific sections of content to optimize for interest
- Identifying any abandonment points and assessing their impact on conversion

For measuring the newsletter subscription goal of "Achieve 2,000 newsletter subscribers with a 25% conversion rate to active search users," an experiment with subscription incentives would include:

- A/B testing different subscription forms (exit-intent popup vs. inline content boxes) to determine optimal placement
- Creating industry-specific lead magnets (e.g., "10 AI Tools Every Retail Business Needs") and tracking conversion by business type
- Testing the effectiveness of social proof elements (subscriber counts, testimonials) on subscription rates
- Defining clear metrics for measuring the journey from subscriber to active search user, such as email click-through to website activity

  Analyzing this data would help refine the content strategy to not only increase traffic numbers but ensure visitors convert to the search functionality, supporting the business model of connecting small business owners with relevant AI tools based on website analysis.

## 1.C.2.3 Ethical Impact(s)/Issue(s)

  For Lans AI's OKR of achieving 85% match accuracy with 70% implementation rates, a primary ethical concern involves algorithmic bias in our small business matching system. If our platform disproportionately recommends expensive AI solutions or favors businesses with existing technical sophistication, we risk widening the digital divide rather than closing it. According to a real-world case, "Small business lending algorithms have been shown to discriminate against minority business owners, with research showing Black-owned businesses were 20% less likely to receive algorithmic loan approvals despite having similar financial profiles" [6].

| Stakeholder | Financial Risk | Privacy Risk | Conflicting Interest Risk |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Small Business Owners | High | High | Mid |
| AI Tool Providers | Mid | Low | High |
| Local Governments | Low | Low | Mid |

  Small Business Owner Stakeholder: The financial risk is high as these businesses operate on thin margins with limited capital. Implementing inappropriate AI tools could deplete critical resources needed for daily operations. Privacy risk is high because our system must analyze website content and business operations, potentially exposing sensitive information about pricing strategies or customer data. Conflicting interest risk is medium as businesses need affordable solutions while our platform might prioritize tools with higher implementation rates to meet our OKR metrics.

## 1.C.2.4 Ethical Safeguards

  The identified risk of algorithmic bias, we propose implementing transparent matching criteria that specifically address potential discrimination. We would develop a "Fairness-First" protocol that evaluates each recommendation for potential bias before presenting it to small business owners. Research supports this approach, with studies showing that "implementing pre-processing bias detection coupled with regular algorithmic audits can reduce discriminatory outcomes in automated recommendation systems by up to 40%" [7].

  We would assemble a diverse ethics board including representatives from minority-owned business associations, AI ethics researchers, and small business owners from various demographics. This board would review our matching algorithms for potential bias and help establish fairness metrics. Implementation would involve creating a technical fairness pipeline that screens recommendations before they reach users, flagging any patterns that show statistically significant disparities across business demographics.

  Effectiveness would be measured through controlled testing, comparing recommendation patterns across different business demographics and monitoring implementation success rates. We would track whether businesses from underrepresented groups receive equally valuable recommendations by measuring ROI across demographic categories after implementation. Regular reports would be published to maintain accountability and continuous improvement.



## 1.C.3.1 OKR3 Objective and Key Result

  Lans AI will maintain an updated quality catalogue of safe AI powered tools in order to better serve customers with current modern day issues. To help make sure that business owners continue to stay satisfied with the products Lans AI offers, each solution must maintain a 50% user satisfaction rating to be promoted to users. That means at least roughly half of the users who use the product should be satisfied with the product they used. User satisfaction will be an important metric in determining which tools are the most useful to our customer base and which companies we should continue to invest more in and continue to partner with. In addition to maintaining a satisfactory user satisfaction rating, the solutions hosted on Lans AI are required to go under a background check by us to ensure that they’re safe to use, and we are not promoting products that are harmful or contradict any of our core values. This also helps to lower any financial and privacy risks between the key stakeholders. The key stakeholders in this OKR are small business owners, their customers, Lans AI, their AI business partners, and their investors. Small business owners will be impacted depending on how well Lans AI is able to provide services that help optimize their business strategies and maximize their available resources. Small business owners’ customers will be impacted based on how well Lans AI provides assistance and whether changes are well implemented. Lans AI will be impacted depending on the need for AI solutions in the business economy, how many shareholders want to invest or partner with Lans AI, and how well Lans AI is able to deliver on their promise. AI Partners will be impacted by how well their products do in the market and how well Lans AI aids them in marketing their product. Investors will be impacted depending on how well Lans AI performs as a company. A minimum user satisfaction rating of 50% will help small business owners’, Lans AI, and Lans AI investors know which AI partners are valuable assets of Lans AI and which ones are not, since a lot of the impact on the stakeholders depends on the quality of the service Lans AI provides to business owners.

## 1.C.3.2 OKR3 Metric(s) with Experiment(s)

  To measure the quality in the products we offer, we will be using user satisfaction as a metric, like we mentioned earlier. User satisfaction will be constructed out of mandatory short user reviews. Each user on Lans AI is required to score a product that they used for more than a month on a score from 1-10, in addition to what they were using the product for and how well it met their needs. The scores will be averaged out to make up the user satisfaction rating. There will also be additional short questions, but users are ultimately not required to submit any further information other than the first three questions to avoid survey fatigue.

As of right now, the short customer satisfaction survey involves these questions:
1. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate this product or service overall? *(required)
2. What purpose(s) were you using our services for? (select all that may apply) *(required)
  - Customer Data Analysis
  - Personalizing Customer Experiences
  - Market Research
  - Etc.
  - Other
3. On a scale of 1-10, How well does this service meet your needs? *(required)
4. Which features felt most valuable to you? (select all that may apply)
  - Data Collection
  - Data Cleaning
  - Customer Personalization
  - Etc.
  - Other
5. Which features did you feel were missing from the AI service or tool? (select all that may apply)
  - Report Generation
  - Predictive Modelling
  - Market Research
  - Etc.
  - Other
6. Which of the following words would you use to describe this AI service?
  - Overpriced
  - Impractical
  - Reliable
  - Unique
  - Poor Quality
  - Ineffective
  - Other
7. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the value of this product, with regards to the money you spent on it?
8. On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this service to others?
9. How satisfied are you with [insert the most well known functional use of this service], on a scale of 1-10.
10. Please rate the following features on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is ‘Not important at all,’ and five is ‘Extremely important.’
11. If you could change just one thing about this product, what would it be? [1]
12. Any other concerns about this product?

   Any user, regardless of whether they have used the product or not, may also provide a word review if they wish to under that product’s page on our website. Lans AI will construct the user satisfaction % primarily based on the first three questions of the survey (1. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate this product or service overall? 2. What purpose(s) were you using our services for? 3. On a scale of 1-10, How well does this service meet your needs?), but will factor in the other survey questions if the users choose to answer them, as well as attempt to factor in website user reviews of all users and weight them accordingly based on whether the user is a verified user of the service and if they’ve been using it for over a month. There is a larger emphasis on the survey questions instead of reviews because this is a mandatory survey that the user must take after they use a product for over a month, in contrast to reviews which can be submitted by any user regardless of whether or not they are a verified purchaser of that AI product. Products below 50% user satisfaction may still remain on Lans AI and be searchable in our database as long as we are still partnered with that AI company, but will be significantly less promoted than solutions that have a user satisfaction rating above 50%. Solutions that have high user satisfaction ratings will be recommended to people more often the higher their rating is.

   By studying user satisfaction in our customer base, we can identify which services we should be investing into.

## 1.C.3.3 Ethical Impact(s)/Issues(s):
Ethical Impact Risk Table:

| Stakeholder | Financial Risk | Privacy Risk | Conflicting Interest Risk | Violation of Rights |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Business Owners | mid | high | low | mid |
| Business Owners' Customers | low | mid | low | low |
| Lans AI | high | low | high | low |
| AI service partners | mid | low | mid | mid |
| Investors | high | low | mid | low |

   Business Owner Stakeholder: The financial risks for business owners are moderate, as the performance of the AI service Lans AI provides affects the success or failure of the business. The business owner will not necessarily risk losing their entire business just because they choose to use Lans AI, but it may pose a risk to the owner depending on the available funds and what percentage of that is invested into Lans AI. After all, Lans AI is only meant to be a platform to provide easy access to vetted AI tools– it is not meant to be the only business management tool a business owner relies on, therefore while the use of Lans AI may affect a business’ performance, it will not cause the immediate downfall of the business in the way other high risk financial investments might have. The privacy risks for business owners are high, as the AI tool will need intimate knowledge of how the business operates and its customer base in order to produce any meaningful results. The primary concern regarding privacy is making sure none of this internal data is leaked or utilized for any other purpose other than what it’s supposed to do. [2] Business owners shouldn’t have to worry about many conflicting interests risks, as many of the other stakeholders share many of the interests business owners have, however, business owners might want different features implemented into Lans AI or want better prices which conflict with the interest of other stakeholders who want to spend their efforts elsewhere. Overall, the risk of business owners’ rights being violated is medium, since if we’re not careful about vetting the AI partners we host or handling data, we may cause a lot of harm to the businesses we’re meant to be helping.

   Business Owner’s Customers Stakeholder: The financial risk the customer of a business should face is very low since the customer is not obligated nor pressured to buy any of the products the business offers. The only risk they take purchasing a product is whether or not they get their money’s worth. Customers might face a moderate amount of privacy risk, since it is their behavior that is being studied and filed away in AI models for business analytics, possibly without their informed consent. There is little risk for conflicting interests, as the only conflicts a business’ customer may have is concerning the price and quality of the product and any customer data that might be stored without their knowledge. There is a low chance of a customer's rights being violated if we and our AI partners follow privacy laws accordingly.

   Lans AI Stakeholder: The financial risk Lans AI takes is extremely high, as the company’s financial success heavily depends on the success of its stakeholders’ success. For Lans AI to earn money or maintain its business model, they must please its customer base– the business owners, Lans AI’s partners– who are providing the AI tools that are hosted on the Lans AI website, and any investors that may have invested great time and money into Lans AI. If Lans AI fails to please any one of these core three groups, they might face great financial loss, even with an otherwise perfect business operation. Lans AI faces minimal privacy risk as there is very little internal data that needs to be passed around to 3rd parties. Rather, it seems as if Lans AI is handling a lot of the private data internally on behalf of their customers and their partners to analyze and better optimize their businesses. The only way their privacy would be at risk is if a data leak were to occur from the company. There is high risk for conflicting interests because Lans AI is the center in which all the stakeholders interact through. Because Lans AI is beholden to a lot of different interests from the stakeholders, the incentive to aid any one of these interests more than the other might compromise the work environment. There is a low chance of Lans AI having their rights violated as they are a protected company under the law. Any actions taken against them must be justified under court of law to go unpunished, which should deter a good number of bad actors from acting out.
   
   AI Partners Stakeholder: The financial risks Lans AI’s partners take are moderate. Much like the business owners, the performance of the AI tools on Lans AI’s website may strongly affect the success or failure of the AI partner depending on how much their business plan relies on their success with Lans AI and what percentage of the partner’s income is invested into Lans AI, but shouldn’t be directly responsible for the downfall of the AI Partner if the partner has established themselves as a reputable company outside of Lans AI. The privacy risks AI Partners take are low, as they shouldn’t need to provide too much internal data to host their tool on Lans AI’s website. Data breaches from Lans AI should be the only risk of privacy to them. There is a moderate amount of conflicting interest for Lans AI Partners depending on how Lans AI serves them. Simultaneously there could be better opportunities that bring in more profit than Lans AI does for the partner. The risk of having their rights violated is very low as contracts should be drafted and followed adequately for both parties to have their rights protected.
   
   Investor Stakeholder: The financial risk any investors have in Lans AI is high as investors rely on Lans AI to succeed in business ventures in order to regain any money or value back from their investment. The privacy risk investors take from working with Lans AI is low, as not much private personal information is needed to invest in a startup company. Not to mention that in case a data breach happens, the sensitive information of the investors is on the lower end of priority when extracting internal data from a company. The risk of conflicting interest is moderate as many types of investors might want Lans AI to act or produce in a certain style that conflicts with other investors. Not to mention, Lans AI is not just beholden to the interest of its investors, but also its customers and partners as well, which might cause conflicts of interest with investors. The risk of violation of rights is low, as the usage of contracts and agreements should square away any risk of rights being violated.

## 1.C.3.4 Ethical Safeguards

LANS AI will enforce strong privacy and security protocols, clearly outlining data use and collection, with options to reject tracking per CCPA. Policies will be crafted with input from legal and cybersecurity experts like Deloitte and EY. To ensure accessibility, the privacy policy will target a 12–15 Flesch-Kincaid readability score. Effectiveness will be measured by user opt-in/out rates, helping gauge clarity and user trust.

## 1.C.4.1 OKR4 Objective and Key Result

  One of the biggest challenges that many businesses face to grow is social awareness and discoverability. In the era of technology, many direct themselves to the internet to obtain information and stay up to date with current situations. Businesses have taken the opportunity to do so with social media, a medium that many use to be able to post their statistics, business information, etc, which can be shared with other individuals or a large group of people. 

  Lans.ai will be able to help support the businesses in identifying what it is, what it represents, its statistics, and other information available to form a presence on social media. If the business does not have a website or is just starting out, Lans.ai will provide tools to begin to be able to format the available information and display it in a way that many can see and understand. Resulting in a good social media presence and a good reputation for being able to share relevant information. Boosting the company's social media pages and ultimately their business.

## 1.C.4.2 OKR3 Metric(s) with Experiment(s)
  The use of AI tools in social media would gain the attention of thousands of users a week. To ensure the high number of views, we run the following tests to get the following results:

- Lans.ai provides a list of tools that would adapt to the company's style and create designs that can get the attention of 1,000 viewers a week.
- Management tools are available to support managing a company's social media page(s), requiring a mild amount of maintenance and supervision to improve efficiency by 25% percent.
   
Lans.ai provides design services that will give the company the ability to present itself in the media to their liking, reaching more than 1,000 viewers a week:
- The services provide a list of AI design tools that can support the business's current design being used for their website (if applicable) to adapt it and present it in a presentable manner on social media platforms to display the company's identity and information.
- If the business is just starting out then the design tools will help in creating different blueprints to let the user choose from a wide range of design choices to match the company's identity.
- The same goes for if the company does not want to make a design but lets the AI tools available to represent the business best and ensure that its information is presented well.

Powerful Management tools are available for the business to help with marketing through social media. Creating a hassle-free experience with little moderation, giving a boost in workforce efficiency by 25%.
- Marketing tools are available to support in conjunction with social media tools to help businesses get the most out of their features on stand-by.
- Such tools require little moderation with user-friendly tools to make sure that the content being created and its information is correct.
- Its easy use of tools from various services can help the business continue and strive with the other methods that AI can use to improve effectiveness and efficiency.

## 1.C.4.3 Ethical Impact(s)/Issue(s)
 When it comes the the usage and distribution of A.I. services, it is both a risk and reward for 3 parties that will be effected. Small Businesses take quite the risk in using A.I. services to expand on social media as it can either support with current infomation and be modified, or be generated without moderation. As well as possibly facing a finacial risk with the impact that may come from using A.I. to help with social media management, alongside the developers of the tools. Potencial issues that have been answered from researchers that have tested their usage and have provided guidance [9]. Social Media users recive a losser impact as the use of the tools by businesses do not directy use or target personal information as it is its own sepreate part.

| Stakeholder | Financial Risk | Privacy Risk | Conflicting Interest Risk | Violation of Rights |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Small Business Owners | High | High | Low | Mid |
| Social Media Users | Low | Low | Low | Low |
| A.I. Service Providers | High | Low | Low | Low |

  Small Business Owners: AI is a powerful form of technology that can change perspectives and choices. As such, using AI to support social media usage can be highly beneficial to the business but can cause disruption. If an AI tool is not properly used to create and display content, can cause financial struggles if it can not reach its particular audience and cause distrust if other parties have some connection to the small business. As sales can possibly drop or even user presence on their social media pages may not reach its goals in reaching its set number of followers or viewers.[9] 

  This is where Lans.ai ai management partners can support in ensuring that its services lower the financial risk, but even then has its caveats. Although the services help reach a target audience, the lack of even a little moderation despite the tool's purpose, results in a privacy risk in the way it gathers data in order to get users to see their social media page. Additionally, if such moderation tools are not used properly to display the business information however the form, can cause damage to the business. Conflict of interest is low as it is used to promote the usage of Ai, its purpose in empowering businesses, and provide services for those in need of an advantage in an ever-growing tech world. Mild Violation of Rights is also present in the use of our AI services and their partners as the tools provided may cause issues with the way they are used and can cause harm.

  Social Media Users: Our AI service tools provide a very low risk for those who are receiving end of the information from small businesses as they have no connection to the users on the social media platform. There is a low privacy risk in the use of AI management tools for both social media and marketing toward our customers as our services follow the terms and conditions of each platform to ensure security and peace of mind as no personal data is collected at all from them for the use of AI tools. The same goes for having no conflict of interest with the user and no rights will be violated as the services are not directly connected to them.

  A.I. Service Providers: For the Providers of these services and powerful tools that were made available to small businesses, can face financial risks. The tools being displayed to the future user of Lans.ai expect professional and well-made tools that help both the providers and businesses grow and improve. Having a good social media presence is crucial to our partners and expect that the tools being used help them reach their goals. A high risk may follow if the user is not satisfied with what the provider offers, which can turn bad for the provider, and must proceed with caution if the service itself begins to gain a bad reputation. Privacy Risk is at a moderate level with our service providers as data breaches are unfortunately common in the tech world and can cause damage to the product by our providers. Conflict of Interest is at a low because we work with the providers to ensure that there is no conflict between other providers. There is also a low yet moderate rights violation due to as mentioned before, data breaches, hacking, and other security issues that can be resolved. [8]

This will include the kind of tools that can be used to ensure social media growth is made to be used in compliance with the terms and conditions of the respective platform that our customers would like to use. Making sure that the rules are being followed and that there would not be any violation of rights and privacy risks. As well as understanding the financial risks that can impact all parties involved should there be any conflict and large-scale issues.

  To our clients, documents will also be provided for them such as our terms and conditions for the use of AI for their business to ensure safe business practices. All of these will be provided along with official documents from each social media platform to ensure that the use of AI on their platforms is done safely. Like our policy with the creation of the AI tool from our partners, a policy will also be presented to the client to make sure that the AI tool is used for its respective purpose and not for malicious use. Report forms will also be made if such AI tools or mechanics are not being used in a proper or ethical manner and will need to be reviewed.

  Knowing the nature of using AI for growth in the online world, our policies and rules will be pushed to all parties including us as a service to establish professionalism and a safe work environment.
